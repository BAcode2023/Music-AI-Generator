# Music-AI-Generator

Music Generator AI Plans
Phase 1: Conceptualization & Planning
Tech stack: django, react,vite, python, sql, css, typescript or javascript
1. Define the Purpose
Goal: Develop an AI-powered web application that generates music based on user input (genre, mood, tempo, etc.) and allows the user to edit the generated music (adjust pitch, tempo, add/remove instruments, and apply effects).
Target Audience: Musicians, producers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in AI-driven music creation and editing.
2. Key Features & Functionalities
AI Music Generation: Generate music based on user input (genre, instruments, mood, etc.).
Customization Options: Users can specify genre, mood, tempo, key, and instrument preferences.
Music Editing Tools:
Tempo Control: Change the speed of the track.
Pitch Control: Adjust the pitch or key of the music.
Volume & Mixing: Adjust volume levels for individual tracks/instruments.
Effect Application: Add reverb, delay, equalizer, and other audio effects.
Looping: Loop specific sections of the music.
Instrument Removal/Addition: Users can remove or add specific instruments to the generated music.
Preview & Edit: Let users preview and fine-tune the music, providing a user-friendly interface for adjustments.
Save & Download: Allow users to save their final edits and download music in various formats (MP3, WAV).
User Accounts: Users can create accounts to save and manage their music files, preferences, and edits.
Music Library: Users can browse their saved music and share them with others.
Social Sharing: Option to share the generated music directly on social media platforms or with friends via a link.
3. Research AI Models
Pre-trained Models: Investigate available pre-trained models like OpenAI's Jukedeck, Google's Magenta, or AIVA for music generation.
Custom Model Development: Consider creating a custom AI model that can generate music with specific characteristics based on user input.
Data: Gather and preprocess datasets (MIDI, sheet music, or raw audio) for training or fine-tuning the AI model.

Part 1: frontend
Look at other competitors - write what you like, what you want to steal and twist, what you don’t want
Design app using figma - inspiration from Dribble, Pinterest, …
Vite + React https://vite.dev
Page by page, component by component

Part 2: backend api
Set up a python api server separate from the react app
Needs accept api requests, and respond back
Ffmpeg for audio transformation
Different track for each instrument is necessary to allow separate transformations
Uploading of audio should be allowed
Probably a good idea to have a base track in the server and a list of transformations to apply on top. Every time the user sends a new transformation, the server should apply it, then respond to the user with a transformed audio file. The server should still “remember”/keep the original audio file without transformations.

MORE TO COME!
